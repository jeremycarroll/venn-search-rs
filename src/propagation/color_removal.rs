//! Completed color removal optimization.
//!
//! When a color forms a complete closed loop, we can optimize the search by
//! restricting all unassigned faces to cycles omitting that color. This also
//! serves as a disconnection check: if any face needs the completed color,
//! then the curve must be disconnected.

/// Remove a completed color from further search consideration.

/// When a color forms a complete closed loop, we can optimize the search by
/// restricting all unassigned faces to cycles omitting that color.
///
/// This also serves as a disconnection check: if any unassigned face NEEDS
/// the completed color (can't be satisfied without it), then the curve must
/// be disconnected (some edges forming a separate component).
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `memo` - Immutable MEMO data
/// * `state` - Mutable search state
/// * `trail` - Trail for backtracking
/// * `color_idx` - Index of the completed color to remove
///
/// # Returns
///
/// `Ok(())` if removal succeeds, `Err(PropagationFailure::DisconnectedCurve)` if any face
/// needs this color (indicating disconnection).
