# Repository review context

Review "jeremycarroll/venn-search-rs" against the issue's selected base (default
"main"). Read `SYMPHONY.md`, existing application
instructions, the Linear issue/project and current human PR feedback. Use the
target's `.symphony.cfg.json` and actual current-head CI evidence.

The onboarding preference is "codex"; runtime selection
uses the credentials actually forwarded to the review job:

| Actions secret availability | Reviewer |
| --- | --- |
| `CADENCE_OPENAI_API_KEY` only | Codex |
| `CADENCE_AI_REVIEW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only | Claude |
| Both | Codex |
| Neither | Early configuration error |

`CADENCE_OPENAI_API_KEY` maps to `openai/codex-action` input `openai-api-key`
(the Codex provider's OpenAI API key, commonly named `OPENAI_API_KEY` outside
Actions). The Anthropic secret maps to `anthropic_api_key` on Claude's Action.
Both reusable-workflow provider declarations are optional; at least one must
reach the job. No dummy key is needed and authentication failure never switches
providers. `CADENCE_CODEX_MODEL` is optional (Codex's default when unset);
Claude requires the shared workflow's approved `CADENCE_CLAUDE_MODEL`.

The generated event, direct/manual and group review callers explicitly forward
both provider secrets and `CADENCE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` / `CADENCE_LINEAR_API_TOKEN`.
Handoff and cleanup receive only their own named secrets; ingress receives none.
Store secrets at repository scope or in organization secrets selected for this
repository. Keep `cadence-controller` restricted to the repository's default
branch and free of shadowing environment secrets. Configure `CADENCE_APP_ID`,
`SYMPHONY_BOT_USER` and `CADENCE_REVIEWER` as repository Actions variables or
organization variables granted to this repository.

The shared workflow and helper revision must match. After the reviewed workflow
release, propagate caller updates through Copier, inspect the generated diff,
and verify a real App-authored PR review/check and Linear handoff. Generated
files and fixture tests do not establish live readiness. Use the
[onboarding skill](../../.agents/skills/cadence-onboarding/SKILL.md) for secure
provisioning and readiness verification.

Keep reviewer implementation in the shared workflows. App/Linear credentials
and optional provider keys must be explicitly mapped at each review boundary.
The author and reviewer remain distinct; human acceptance owns merge and Done.

## Current Cadence status

The pinned shared status-comment revision lets Cadence edit one App-owned
PR comment as reviews queue, run, complete or fail. It shows the current verdict,
a brief assessment and up to three findings, with links to the head, run and
formal review. Detailed history remains in reviews, runs and the Linear workpad.

The footer uses observed model/token usage when the provider exposes it and
measured review duration. Requested models are labeled separately; unavailable
measurements are omitted. Codex's pinned Action currently supplies no structured
observed model or token counts. Elapsed provider-step time can include setup.

Admission, review start, completion and recovery request the existing Cadence
App's PR-write grant for comment edits; no new App installation grant or secret
is needed. Keep the generated caller and helper revision matched. When adopting this template revision, apply the caller changes through Copier
and verify one
live App-authored comment is edited across reviews. Generated-file validation does not establish live deployment; the root client
may still use its separately recorded older template source.
